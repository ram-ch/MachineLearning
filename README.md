### Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA] on Haberman dataset    
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ram-ch/MachineLearning/blob/master/Notebooks/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20on%20Haberman%20Dataset.ipynb)


In this note book I have analysed the Habernam data set to understand the behaviour of the data and have made few interesting observations. All my insights are inferred from various visualizations on the data


### Descriptive Analytics [Visualizations] on Customer Churn dataset    
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ram-ch/MachineLearning/blob/master/Notebooks/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20on%20Customer%20Churn%20Dataset.ipynb)


In this note book I have analysed the Customer Churn data set to understand the behaviour of the data and have made few interesting observations about who, what and why the customers are leaving a certain bank. All my insights are inferred from various visualizations on the data


### Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors On Drug Review Dataset        
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ram-ch/MachineLearning/blob/master/Notebooks/Classification_with_KNN_On_Drug_Review_Dataset.ipynb)        

In this note book I have applied K nearest neighbors algorithm to perform a classification task on Drug review data set. This analysis classifies the drugs based on the patients reviews.
